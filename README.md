# About Me
Nick Wechter (He/Him) is currently a master's student of Healthcare Policy and Management at Carnegie Mellon University. Upon completion of his degree, Nick hopes to find a place for himself at the intersection of the Life Sciences and Healthcare industries.

Nick enjoys playing and watching basketball, cooking, as well as experimenting with veganism (inspired by The Game Changers, on Netflix). In his free time, Nick can be found tending to his house plants, grilling, or biking around Pittsburgh.

# What I hope to learn
Data is all around us. I would like to learn to better interact with visual data as a consumer and producer of information. I am particularly interested in learning how to better communicate concepts to broad audiences through deliberate visual design. 

# Portfolio
In progress!
